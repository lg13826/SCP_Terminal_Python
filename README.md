Variant of my first programming project rewritten in Python.

# Concept
The program is relatively simple. It attempts to act as a form of access terminal to the website of the SCP mythos. Utilizing the program you can access SCP files directly without needing to navigate the site. An attempt at making it feel more in-universe was made and as a result flavorful text is encouraged when making changes or additions to the program.

# How to Run
The program only has a single .py file, Terminal.py.

# How to Contribute
Make a fork of the main branch and make any committments in a seperate file if including a new function or class. 
If it modifies the core program make sure to let me know and I'll resolve merge conflicts if they come up.

# Formatting Style
Ensure you run all python code through Black8 and use pep8 coding conventions.
